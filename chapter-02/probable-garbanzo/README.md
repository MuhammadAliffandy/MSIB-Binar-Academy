## This is a challenge for chapter 2 to combine landing page from chap 01 and create some page have a search machine
okay, In this challenge have a 2 part to clear the submission.
For challenge 2 part 1, I create the algorithm of filter and bubble sort with Javascript Languange and dont use a sort method from js. Just create the algorithm. And part 2 have a UI to slicing with front end and add the DOM manipulation , after this dont forget to create a back end to create the search machine use data from api. 

## Build With
- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) - HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages.
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - Extensive list of components and Bundled Javascript plugins ( Boostrap v5.2 ).
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) - is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate      images, and pretty much everything else.

## FYI 

-  I use Html and css to create a ui structure design to have a easy code from read and repeat write . CSS is colorful to manipulation effect and responsivble   if havent use framework
- Boostrap is so helpful to implemen component like a offcanvas , form , navbar , dropdown , caraousel and many layouting with grid. And I combine the        boostrap with only css to make a website to be good and responsive.
- Dont forget to use JS DOM and BE to create a search machine from page 2 and manipulation UI to many effect and aesthetic component so lets see my Website
