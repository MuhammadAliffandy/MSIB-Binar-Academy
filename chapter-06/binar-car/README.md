## This is a challenge for chapter 6 to convert chapter 2 to React Web Apps
First , I create the react project with CRA ( Vite ) and I am using JSX to create many component for a build more page in my website and you can easy using my project if follow my documentaion.

## Build With
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) - is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate      images, and pretty much everything else.
- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en) - Node.jsÂ® is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
- [React JS](https://react.dev/) - The library for web and native user interfaces.
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) -  Declarative routing for React web applications.
- [MUI](https://mui.com/) - MUI offers a comprehensive suite of free UI tools to help you ship new features faster..

- I in my project have a one algorithm to fetch the api to for a render car data from server and this is use the react context to consume with state managaement data for easy using of all component in different place.
