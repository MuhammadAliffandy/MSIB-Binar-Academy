## This is a challenge for chapter 4 to create API with Postgres 
My API create with Javascript Languange and use a more dependency like a ORM to handle SQL Query from Postgres and you can test my Api in local host and create your db in dbms pgAdmin. And its have a front end to test Api and make a good experience user.

## Build With
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) - is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate      images, and pretty much everything else.
- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en) - Node.jsÂ® is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
- [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/) - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) - Creating UUID code with useful package in Node js.
- [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org) - Sequelize is a modern TypeScript and Node.js ORM for Oracle, Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and SQL Server, and more.
- [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) - Multer is a node.js middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is primarily used for uploading files. It is written on top of busboy for maximum efficiency


## FYI 

- Okay First i use JS languange to create the algorithm and write many code with this.
- Used Node js to make a enviroment and integrated if use many dependecy to make complex apps or program.
- Express JS this a web framework and this is so helpful to create web service and server - client. and i make it in my API and to implementation middleware , routing and handle method from client request .
- uuid is package to create or to build the code random for data id.
- Data in my api used Postgres and DBMS PgAdmin in local. To integrate server and database , i use ORM to make useful algorihtm from code program and make to easy.
- In my dependecy i use Multer, multer is some library to fetch request file type like a images. And my api make form data if you use with software testing api.

## Getting Started

if you need to start api from your local and you want to change more algorithm from this, u can cloning first:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/MuhammadAliffandy/MSIB-Binar-Academy.git
$ cd chapter-04
```

## Usage

before you run this you must installation package to make the program its not error for u.

```sh
$ npm install
```

run the server with Node JS runtime and i am used Node JS v 18+

```sh
$ npm run start
```
NB : While the command running Client ( FrontEnd ) and Server run together. Because I use concurrently dependecy to run together.

Many API endpoints return the JSON representation of the resources created or edited. and following : 
```javascript
{
  "message" : string,
  "data"    : string
}
```
The `message` attribute contains a message commonly used to indicate errors or, in the case of deleting a resource, success that the resource was properly deleted.

The `data` attribute contains any other metadata associated with the response. This will be an escaped string containing JSON data.

## Data Structure ( to Create new Data )

if u need testing api with app test you can send req with form data and upload image with file type. Then data with JSON string

```javascript

{
  image : BLOB ,
}

{
  name : string;
  rentPerDay: number;
  size: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

## Method and EndPoint

The method from API following :

| Endpoint | Method | 
| :--- | :--- |
| .../| GET |
| .../cars/ | GET |
| .../cars/:id | GET |
| .../cars | POST |
| .../cars/:id | PUT |
| .../cars/:id | DELETE |

## Status Codes

API is returns the following status codes:

| Status Code | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| 200 | `OK` |
| 201 | `CREATED` |
| 404 | `NOT FOUND` |
| 500 | `INTERNAL SERVER ERROR` |
